# StreamLabsStreamSwitcher
An automatic scene switcher for StreamLabs OBS

This is still pretty raw, but the core concepts are there. I may extend this with a UI and make it nicer. Right now, you have to manually hard-code your scene names, and the target executable that you want to monitor and build it yourself. But it shows the concepts! :)
