# StreamLabsStreamSwitcher
An automatic scene switcher for StreamLabs OBS

By default this will switch between two scenes. 

* "Main" is the default scene. This scene is displayed when no "League of Legends" window is available. 
* "In Game" is the scene that the application will notify StreamLabs OBS to switch to when "League of Legends" is launched. 

You can modify appsettings.json to change the names of the scenes or the window title to monitor. 

You can modify the code to extend it to send other commands to the StreamLabs OBS named pipe API (slobs).
